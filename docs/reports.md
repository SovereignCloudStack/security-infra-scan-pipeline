# Using Automated Pentesting Reports for CSPs, Operators, and Users

This section outlines how Infrastructure Operators (Cloud Service Providers - CSPs) and users can leverage automated pentesting reports focused on Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) environments. 
It explains the importance of daily and weekly reports for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and security gaps in cloud infrastructure. Additionally, this documentation describes actionable
processes for vulnerability management, tailored for both environments, and provides insights for operations with and without a Security Operations Center (SOC).

## Understanding the Pentesting Reports for IaaS and CaaS

Pentesting reports for IaaS and CaaS layers focus on identifying security weaknesses in cloud infrastructure and containerized environments. These reports are generated by automated tools designed to scan for:

- **Open Ports** and **exposed services** in IaaS environments.
- **Container Security**: Assessing containerized environments for misconfigurations, unpatched vulnerabilities, and insecure networking settings.
- **Cloud Misconfigurations**: Ensuring proper IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies, storage bucket configurations, and other cloud resource settings.
- **Compliance Gaps**: Ensuring alignment with security policies and regulatory frameworks like CIS benchmarks and industry-specific standards.

### Importance of Daily and Weekly Reports

#### Daily Reports
Daily reports provide real-time insights into the current state of cloud infrastructure. They focus on:

- **Immediate Vulnerabilities**: New misconfigurations, exposed services or detected container security flaws.
- **Rapid Incident Response**: Helping CSPs and operators address critical issues quickly, reducing the window of exposure.
- **Change Monitoring**: Keeping track of changes in cloud and container environments that could introduce risks, particularly for systems with continuous updates.

#### Weekly Reports
Weekly reports give a broader view of security health, highlighting trends and recurring issues. They are used to:

- **Strategize Long-term Remediation**: Address systemic problems like consistently misconfigured security groups or recurring container vulnerabilities.
- **Track Progress**: Monitor how quickly vulnerabilities are being resolved and track overall improvement in security posture.
- **Policy Compliance**: Provide a comprehensive overview for audits and compliance reporting, ensuring that security frameworks are being adhered to.

### Key Characteristics and Capabilities of Reports

- **Actionable Insights**: Each report prioritizes vulnerabilities by severity, allowing teams to act efficiently and allocate resources accordingly.
- **Compliance Assurance**: Continuous monitoring and scanning ensure compliance with security standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CIS benchmarks.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Reports encompass vulnerabilities at different layers—network, applications, and containers—identifying open ports, unpatched software, and web app flaws.

## Role and Responsibilities of Operators and Users

### For Operators (high-level view):
Operators (CSPs) have a responsibility to ensure the security of the IaaS and CaaS layers they manage to protect their services and customer data. Key responsibilities include:

- **Daily Monitoring**: Use tools like Naabu and Httpx for open port discovery and service monitoring. Remediate any critical issues immediately, especially for public-facing services.
- **Configuration Audits**: Regularly assess cloud resource configurations using Nuclei and other compliance-focused tools to ensure adherence to security policies.
- **Container Vulnerability Management**: Ensure that containerized environments are properly isolated, updated, and hardened against known vulnerabilities.

### For Operator's staff:
Operators are responsible for managing the security of cloud infrastructure, taking action based on the findings in the pentesting reports. Responsibilities include:

- **Triage and Response**: Review daily reports to prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities such as misconfigurations or container escape risks. Act immediately to close exposed ports or restrict access where needed.
- **Patch Management**: Use weekly reports to identify vulnerabilities that require patching or configuration changes, especially in CaaS environments where container images may have known flaws.
- **Long-term Fixes**: Address recurring issues by implementing security controls that reduce the likelihood of similar vulnerabilities appearing in the future.

### For Users (DevOps):
DevOps teams must integrate security into the development lifecycle for IaaS and CaaS environments:

- **Embed Tools in CI/CD**: Automated scanning tools should be part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities before production deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use pentesting insights to continuously improve cloud configuration templates, ensuring best practices are embedded in every deployment.
- **Monitor Application Security**: Continuously review reports to ensure that containerized applications are not introducing new vulnerabilities or compliance issues.

## Actions Based on Pentesting Reports

- **Review Daily Reports**
  - Prioritize Critical Vulnerabilities: Focus first on critical issues such as open ports, misconfigurations, and unpatched containers. Use tools like Naabu for open ports and ZAP Proxy for application layer vulnerabilities.
  - Validate Exposed Services: Ensure any services flagged as exposed are necessary. If not, restrict or close access.
- **Immediate Response**
  - Apply Patches: For vulnerabilities in container images or cloud configurations, apply patches immediately using automated pipelines where possible.
  - Remediate Misconfigurations: Correct any misconfigurations flagged in identity, access management (IAM), or resource policies to prevent exploitation.
- **Automate Responses**
  - Use Predefined Rules: Set up automatic responses for common issues such as closing ports or restarting vulnerable services. Implement this via configuration management tools or CI/CD pipelines.
  - Integration with Monitoring Tools: Integrate the pentesting results with monitoring tools for real-time alerting and response automation, reducing manual efforts.
- **Document Actions**
  - Track Resolutions: Use vulnerability management platforms like DefectDojo to track issues resolved throughout the day. Ensure all critical vulnerabilities are documented and tracked to completion.
  - Generate Daily Reports for Management: Summarize critical vulnerabilities addressed and ongoing risks for reporting purposes.
- **Plan for Continuous Scans**
  - Rerun Scans After Fixes: Ensure new scans are initiated after significant patches or configuration changes to validate that vulnerabilities have been fully mitigated.
- **Feedback Loop**
  - Refine Pipelines: Use insights from recurring vulnerabilities or issues to improve your IaaS and CaaS configuration templates and pentesting configurations.

By following these steps daily, teams can ensure they stay on top of vulnerabilities, continuously improving their cloud infrastructure security posture.

## SOC Operations

A SOC (Security Operations Center) is crucial for larger organizations to centralize threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response. 
It allows for rapid response to vulnerabilities identified in pentesting reports, providing 24/7 monitoring and remediation capabilities.
However it is also possible for smaller teams (without a dedicated SOC) to take advantage of these reports.

### With a SOC
- **Daily Triage and Monitoring**: SOC teams use pentesting reports to triage vulnerabilities, prioritizing critical risks such as exposed ports, misconfigurations, and unpatched containers.
- **Vulnerability Ticketing**: Use platforms like DefectDojo to assign vulnerabilities to appropriate teams, tracking their resolution.
- **Incident Response**: High-priority vulnerabilities are immediately addressed, with automated workflows in place to deploy fixes or isolate compromised services.
- **Documentation**: Weekly reports are used for documenting resolved vulnerabilities and tracking recurring issues, providing a basis for long-term improvements.

### Without a SOC:
- **Manual Review**: Without a SOC, designated IT or DevOps teams must manually review daily pentesting reports. High-risk vulnerabilities should be addressed immediately, while lower-risk issues can be prioritized based on business impact.
- **Automation**: Automate remediation processes where possible (e.g., automated patching of containers or closing of exposed ports) to reduce manual effort and response time.
- **Long-term Monitoring**: Use weekly reports to monitor recurring vulnerabilities and address the root causes, ensuring systemic issues are resolved over time.

## Future Policy Development

Pentesting reports not only drive immediate security actions but also form the backbone for long-term security policy development. 
They provide a continuous stream of vulnerability data that can be used to craft policies around patch management, incident response, and compliance enforcement. This continuous cycle of vulnerability identification and remediation supports the development of:

- **Risk-Based Patch Management Policies**: Define timelines for addressing vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact on cloud services.
- **Security Audits and Compliance**: Use the reports as evidence of compliance with industry standards, like CIS benchmarks ir GPDR, allowing for continuous audits and ensuring regulatory alignment.
- **Incident Response Plans**: Establish guidelines for handling vulnerabilities identified in pentesting reports, ensuring quick and effective responses to critical risks.

## Conclusion
Pentesting reports provide crucial insights that enable CSPs, operators, and users to maintain a proactive security posture. 
SOC teams, or in their absence, designated personnel, should use these reports to address vulnerabilities, manage risks, and improve infrastructure security. 
Daily and weekly reports guide both immediate and long-term actions, ensuring that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and systemic issues are resolved through strategic security improvements.

By using pentesting reports effectively, organizations can improve their vulnerability management processes, maintain compliance, and enhance their overall security strategy.
